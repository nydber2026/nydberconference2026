    <h2>About the Conference</h2>
    <p>
        The <strong>Upstate NY Discipline-Based Education Research (DBER) Conference 2026</strong> brings together
        STEM education researchers and practitioners from across upstate New York for an interdisciplinary 1.5-day
        gathering at Cornell University on June 11&ndash;12, 2026. The conference theme is
        <em>Interdisciplinary Research and Collaboration</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Conference activities will include a poster session, facilitated working groups centered on conference themes,
        and structured networking opportunities designed to build regional collaborations across DBER fields including
        GER, EER, PER, RUME, CER, and BER.
    </p>
    <p>
        This conference aims to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Explore supports and barriers to interdisciplinary collaborations across upstate New York</li>
        <li>Share research emerging from existing cross-disciplinary and multi-institutional work</li>
        <li>Advance collective understanding of and potential for interdisciplinary projects across our regional and institutional contexts</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This conference is supported by the National Science Foundation (Award #2430496). Thanks to this support,
        we expect to offer <strong>travel stipends</strong> to help offset participation costs (travel, hotel, and meals)
        for a number of attendees, as funds allow.
